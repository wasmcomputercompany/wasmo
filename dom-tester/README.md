# DOM Tester

Snapshot testing for HTML DOMs.


### Files in Kotlin/JS

Kotlin/JS browser tests run via [Karma]. It runs a NodeJS service, which serves the HTML page,
and that hosts the in-browser tests.

We have a custom Karma middleware that implements these endpoints:

  * `GET /snapshots/{path}`: Reads a snapshot file from the local file system. Returns 200 if
    the file is found, and 404 if it does not.

  * `POST /snapshots/{path}`: Writes a snapshot file to the local file system.


### DOM Snapshots

We snapshot HTML elements using [html-to-image].
